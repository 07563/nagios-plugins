Nagios Plugins README
---------------------

* For instructions on installing these plugins for use with Nagios, read
  the INSTALL file.

* For information on what changes have been made or plugin have been added,
  read the Changelog file.

* Some plugins require that you have additional programs and/or
  libraries installed on your system before they can be used.  Plugins
  that are dependent on other programs/libraries that are missing are
  usually not compiled. Read the REQUIREMENTS file for more information.

* Individual plugins are self documenting.  All plugins that comply with
  the basic guidelines for development will provide detailed help when
  invoked with the '-h' option ('--help' also, if long options are enabled).

* The file command.cfg contains example configurations for many of the
  plugins

judgment.
