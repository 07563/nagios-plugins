Nagios Plugins Quick-and-Dirty Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------

0) If using the CVS tree, you need:
	gnu make 3.79
	automake 1.9.2
	autoconf 2.58

   To start out, run:
	tools/setup

1) Run the configure script to initialize variables and create a Makefile, etc.
	./configure --prefix=BASEDIRECTORY --with-cgiurl=SOMEURL

   a) Replace BASEDIRECTORY with the path of the directory under which Nagios
      is installed (default is '/usr/local/nagios')
   b) Replace CGIURL with the path used to access the Nagios CGIs with
      a web browser (default is '/nagios/cgi-bin')


2) Compile the plugins with the following command:
	make all


3) Test the plugins:
	make test

   You will need to answer questions on servers that can be used for testing. If
   you need to edit any values, edit the file /var/tmp/NPTest.cache


4) Install the compiled plugins and plugin scripts with the following command:
	make install

   NOTE: 
   The installation procedure will attempt to place the plugins in a 
   'libexec/' subdirectory in the base directory you specified with
   the --prefix argument to the configure script.


5) Verify that your host configuration file (hosts.cfg) for Nagios contains
   the correct paths to the new plugins.
