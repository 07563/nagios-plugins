This file documents the major additions and syntax changes between releases.

1.4
	check_http --min changed to --pagesize, added max so min:max in check

	Internationalisation support
	Performance data added (not all plugins yet)
	check_vsz and check_rss deprecated - functionality moved into check_procs
	check_swap % thresholds changed to measure amount free, instead of amount used
	check_disk syntax changes for -p, -m/-M, defaults to MB instead of kB
	check_procs -C expects no path for the command name
	New plugins - check_dhcp, check_icmp

Caveats, Notes

1 check_dhcp and check_icmp may not build or run on all architectures. Both plugins should be regarded
  as volatile (subject to change - see the CVS if in doubt). cd plugins && make plugin' to build.

1.1 check_dhcp: tested successfully on Linux and FreeBSD; fails on Solaris 9; unknown on HPUX and AIX
1.2 check_icmp: recently renamed by the author (A Ericsson) to 'check_rta' and substantially updated.
		check_icmp is known to run on *FreeBSD.
