Nagios Plugin Requirements
--------------------------

Some plugins require that you have additional programs and/or
libraries installed on your system before they can be used.  Plugins
that are dependent on other programs/libraries that are missing are
usually not compiled.  Requirements for various plugins are listed
below...

check_fping:
	- Requires the fping utility distributed with SATAN.  Either
	  download and install SATAN or grab the fping program from
	  http://www.stanford.edu/~schemers/docs/fping/fping.html
		ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/libc6/SRPMS/fping-2.2b1-1.src.rpm 
		ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/libc6/RPMS/fping-2.2b1-1.i386.rpm 
	  Note that the fping command must be setuid root to function.

check_game:
	- Requires the qstat utility available from
	  http://www.activesw.com/people/steve/qstat.html
	  Last tested on qstat 2.3d BETA

check_hpjd:
	- Requires the UCD-SNMP package available from 
	  http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu
	  The snmpget binary is all that is required.
